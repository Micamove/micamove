			<h3>Warranty Info</h3>
		</div>
	</header>

	<section class="row-fluid support-content">
		<p class="span6">
			A limited warranty comes with each Mica watch. Mica covers defects in materials and workmanship for a period of one(1) year after original purchase from micamove.com or an authorized reseller. Pre-order item warranty begins on the first day of shipment. Defects are repaired or replaced at our discretion. Normal wear and tear, band, batteries, crystal, watch case, loss or theft are not covered. Links and casing on all current models of watches sold are made of pure wood and treated with our proprietary SolidCore™ wood science technology to improve durability, luster and resistance to the elements. Although this seals and finishes your watch from the inside out, the case and movement are splash resistant. All warranty will be void if you submerge your watch in water or open up the crown and expose it to moisture.
		</p>
		<p class="span6">
			All warranty will be void if you open the case for any reason. If you are unsure of the warranty explained above or would like to schedule your watch for service or repair just drop us a line at service@micamove.com.
			<br>
			<br>
			Do NOT return your watch to sender or retail location, you must receive an RA(Return Authorization) number and the correct service or repair location by contacting service@micamove.com. Items shipped without an RA number may be refused at time of delivery by the receiving department at Mica. Customer is responsible for all items shipped without an RA number. Customer is responsible for all return shipping costs.

			Each Mica watch can be sized to fit any wrist. Extra links are included as well as three precision adjustment settings located on the clasp. Links can be added or removed using mini screwdrivers found in common eyeglass kits.
			<br>
			<br>
			1. To add or remove links, unscrew link pins using 2 flathead screwdrivers on either side (small jewelry screwdrivers) then insert or remove extra links. The screwdrivers needed can be found at most supermarkets or hardware stores for $0.99.
			<br>
			<br>
			2. For a precise fit, remove spring pin from the clasp using the end of a paper clip, tooth pick or thumb tack. Insert spring pin back into any of the three sizing holes.
			<br>
			<br>
			3. If you’re not the do it yourself type, take your watch to any jewelry store to fit it for you.
